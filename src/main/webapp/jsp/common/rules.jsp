            <ul>
                <li>Each week, you will select which football team you think will cover the spread in each game.</li>
                <li>Each successful pick is worth one point.</li>
                <li>You may change your pick(s) at any time up until the start of each individual game.</li>
                <li>Picks for all players will be visible as each game gets started (see League Picks tab). Thus, on Sunday @ noon you will be able to view everyone's picks for the morning games, but the afternoon games will still be hidden.</li>
                <li>DEFAULT PICKS - If you forget to make your picks or choose not to make a selection for one or more games, your picks will be submitted for you at the start of each game. The team selected is based on your preference in the User Profile page (Home, Away, Favorite, Underdog). Default picks made by the system will be noted on the picks page.</li>
                <li>In the case where the game ends in a tie based on the spread (Carolina 24 - Green Bay 21 , GB +3), all players will earn one point for their pick.</li>
                <li>The top player(s) with the most picks each week wins the weekly prize. If more than one person has the most picks, each person will equally share the weekly prize.</li>
                <li>At then end of the regular season, the top overall players will be awarded the grand prize. The number of places paid will be determined by the number of paid players at the start of the season.</li>

                <li>Each week, you will select one team you are certain will cover the spread. This is your 'Lock of the Week'.</li>
                <li>This pick can be any team playing that week.</li>
                <li>Each team you choose correctly will earn you one point.</li>
                <li>In order for you to get a point, YOU MUST HAVE AN OUTRIGHT WINNER.</li>
                <li>Your default pick <u>DOES NOT</u> cover the lock of the week. You must make this selection yourself.</li>
                <li>Once your selected team's game has started, you will no longer be able to change your selection.</li>
                <li>The player who correctly predicts the most locks at the end of the year will win the prize.</li>
                <li>In case of a tie at the end of the year, the player with the most ties will win the tiebreaker. Remaining players with an equal number of ties will split the payout.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The objective is to basically SURVIVE from week to week by selecing a winning team WITHOUT THE SPREAD.</li>
                <li>Each week you will choose one team (NO POINT SPREAD) to win their game.</li>
                <li>If the team you selected WINS their game, YOU SURVIVE THE WEEK and move on to the next week.</li>
                <li>However, YOU MAY USE EACH TEAM ONLY ONCE THE ENTIRE SEASON!</li>
                <li>If the team you select loses or ties that week, you are eliminated!</li>
                <li>You may select any team playing that week, even if you choose not to select them in your Picks pool.</li>
                <li>In the special case where a game ends in a tie (it does happen!), all players who chose either team as their survivor pick will be eliminated. Your team must win the game outright!</li>
                <li>The player(s) who survive the longest will split the prize. You do not have to survive the entire season, but only survive longer than everyone else.</li>
